# System16

Well, that was a wild couple of days.

Was having some odd issues with memory alignment, pointers,
heaps of stuff - was difficults to visualise what was 
going on.

Anyway, I built a little debugger that let's you view the
registers, data and code with a program executes, obviously
slows things down a bit but it's easy to enable/disable.

For now it's enabled all the time but I'll add a feature
that let's you open/close it at runtime.


## I/O libraries

I started writing some basic I/O libraries that I can use
to build a shell, got a print and getline function working,
the demo app can be viewed at:
